235--Lab - Working with files
In this lab, you will:
* Create a backup file of an entire folder structure using `tar`
* Log the creation of the backup in a file with the date, time, and file name of the backup file
* Transfer the backup file to another folder

---

### Duration
This lab requires approximately 30 minutes to complete.

---

### AWS Service Restrictions
In this lab environment, access to AWS services and service actions might be restricted to the ones that you need to complete the lab instructions. You might encounter errors if you attempt to access other services or perform actions beyond the ones that this lab describes.

---

### Accessing the AWS Management Console
At the top of these instructions, choose **Start Lab** to launch your lab. A **Start Lab** panel opens and displays the lab status.

**Tip:** If you need more time to complete the lab, choose the **Start Lab** button again to restart the timer for the environment.

Wait until you see the message **Lab status: ready**, then close the **Start Lab** panel by choosing the **X**.

At the top of these instructions, choose **AWS**. This opens the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system will automatically log you in.

**Tip:** If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon is usually at the top of your browser with a message that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon and then choose **Allow pop ups**.

Arrange the AWS Management Console tab so that it displays alongside these instructions. Ideally, you will be able to see both browser tabs at the same time so that you can follow the lab steps more easily.

### Task 1: Use SSH to connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance
In this task, you will connect to an Amazon Linux EC2 instance. You will use an SSH utility to perform all of these operations. The following instructions vary slightly depending on whether you are using Windows or Mac/Linux.

#### Windows Users: Using SSH to Connect
These instructions are specifically for Windows users. If you are using macOS or Linux, skip to the next section.

1.  Select the **Details** drop-down menu above these instructions you are currently reading, and then select **Show**. A **Credentials** window will be presented.
2.  Select the **Download PPK** button and save the `labsuser.ppk` file. Typically your browser will save it to the `Downloads` directory.
3.  Make a note of the **PublicIP** address.
4.  Then exit the **Details** panel by selecting the **X**.
5.  Download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to SSH into the Amazon EC2 instance. If you do not have PuTTY installed on your computer, download it [here](https://www.putty.org/download.html).
6.  Open `putty.exe`.
7.  Configure your PuTTY session by following the directions in the following link: [Connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).
8.  **Windows Users: Select here to skip ahead to the next task.**

#### macOS and Linux Users
These instructions are specifically for Mac/Linux users. If you are a Windows user, skip ahead to the next task.

1.  Select the **Details** drop-down menu above these instructions you are currently reading, and then select **Show**. A **Credentials** window will be presented.
2.  Select the **Download PEM** button and save the `labsuser.pem` file.
3.  Make a note of the **PublicIP** address.
4.  Then exit the **Details** panel by selecting the **X**.
5.  Open a terminal window, and change directory `cd` to the directory where the `labsuser.pem` file was downloaded. For example, if the `labuser.pem` file was saved to your `Downloads` directory, run this command:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```
6.  Change the permissions on the key to be read-only, by running this command:
    ```bash
    chmod 400 labsuser.pem
    ```
7.  Run the below command (replace `<public-ip>` with the **PublicIP** address you copied earlier). Alternatively, return to the EC2 Console and select **Instances**. Check the box next to the instance you want to connect to and in the **Description** tab copy the **IPv4 Public IP** value:
    ```bash
    ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
    ```
8.  Type `yes` when prompted to allow the first connection to this remote SSH server. Because you are using a key pair for authentication, you will not be prompted for a password.

### Task 2: Create a backup
In this task, you create a backup of an entire file structure. Your work environment has the following folder structure:
