235--Lab - Working with files
In this lab, you will:
* Create a backup file of an entire folder structure using `tar`
* Log the creation of the backup in a file with the date, time, and file name of the backup file
* Transfer the backup file to another folder

*Figure: The image above shows the current folder structure with `/home/ec2-user` as the top with `CompanyA` directly below it. Within `CompanyA`, you have the following folders with corresponding files: `Employees` (`Schedules.csv`), `Finance` (`Salary.csv`), `HR` (`Managers.csv` and `Assessments.csv`), `IA`, `Management` (`Promotions.csv` and `Sections.csv`), and `SharedFolders` (empty).*

You will use `tar` to create a backup.

1.  To ensure that you are in the `/home/ec2-user/` folder, enter the following command into the terminal and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ ~]$ pwd
    /home/ec2-user
    ```

2.  To validate that the `CompanyA` folder exists, enter the following command into the terminal and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    ls -R CompanyA
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ ~]$ ls /home/ec2-user/CompanyA
    CompanyA/:
    Employees  Finance  HR  IA  Management  SharedFolders

    CompanyA/Employees:
    Schedules.csv

    CompanyA/Finance:
    Salary.csv

    CompanyA/HR:
    Assessments.csv  Managers.csv

    CompanyA/IA:

    CompanyA/Management:
    Promotions.csv  Sections.csv
    ```

3.  To back up the entire `CompanyA` folder structure recursively, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    tar -csvpzf backup.CompanyA.tar.gz CompanyA
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    CompanyA/
    CompanyA/Management/
    CompanyA/Management/Sections.csv
    CompanyA/Management/Promotions.csv
    CompanyA/Employees/
    CompanyA/Employees/Schedules.csv
    CompanyA/Finance/
    CompanyA/Finance/Salary.csv
    CompanyA/HR/
    CompanyA/HR/Managers.csv
    CompanyA/HR/Assessments.csv
    CompanyA/IA/
    CompanyA/SharedFolders/
    ```

4.  To verify that the archive was created, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ ~]$ CompanyA backup.CompanyA.tar.gz
    ```
    The `backup.CompanyA.tar.gz` folder contains all the folders and files in the `CompanyA` folder. You can copy it and unzip it to get the entire structure in another location or host.

---

### Task 3: Log the backup
In this task, you create a file for logging the date, time, and file name of the backup tar file that you created. This file indicates when you created backups and could be useful to avoid creating unnecessary backups in the future.

1.  To navigate to the `CompanyA` folder, enter the following command into the terminal and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    cd /home/ec2-user/CompanyA
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    ec2-user@ ~]$ cd /home/ec2-user/CompanyA
    [ec2-user@ CompanyA]$
    ```

2.  To create an empty backup file named `backups.csv`, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    touch SharedFolders/backups.csv
    ```

3.  To add the date, time, and file name to the `backups.csv` file, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    echo "25 Aug 25 2021, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz" | sudo tee SharedFolders/backups.csv
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ CompanyA]$  echo "25 Aug 25 2019, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar gz" | sudo tee SharedFolders/backups
    25 Aug 25 2019, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz
    ```
    **Note:** You may be unfamiliar with the `tee` command and `|` redirector, but you will learn about them later. You can use the `tee` command to write information both in the terminal and in a file. The `|` redirector redirects the output of the `echo` command to the second command, `tee`, which writes it to both the terminal and the `SharedFolders/backups.csv` file.

4.  To display the content of the file, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    cat SharedFolders/backups.csv
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ CompanyA]$ cat SharedFolders/backups.csv
    25 Aug 25 2021, 16:59, backup.CompanyA.tar.gz
    ```

### Task 4: Move the backup file
In this task, you transfer the backup file to the `IA` folder. In a real-life scenario, you could follow these steps to make the file accessible to another user or team that does not have access to the folder where you created the backup file.

1.  To validate that you are in the `CompanyA` folder in the terminal, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ CompanyA]$ pwd
    /home/ec2-user/CompanyA
    ```

2.  To transfer the backup file to the `IA` team computer, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    mv ../backup.CompanyA.tar.gz IA/
    ```

3.  To verify that the backup file was moved, enter the following command and press `Enter`.
    ```bash
    ls . IA
    ```
    **Expected output:**
    ```
    [ec2-user@ CompanyA]$ ls . IA
    .:
    Employees  Finance  HR  IA  Management  SharedFolders

    IA:
    backup.CompanyA.tar.gz
    ```
    This command lists the content of both the current folder, `CompanyA`, and the `IA` folder. The backup file is not in the current folder anymore and was moved to the `IA` folder.

### About the AWS component
Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes so that you can scale your resources to the requirements of your target workload.
This lab uses a `t3.micro` instance, which should be selected by default. This instance type has 1 virtual CPU and 1 GiB of memory.
