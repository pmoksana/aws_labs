cd ~/Downloads
chmod 400 labsuser.pem
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>

Task 2: Review secure log files
In this task, you use common Linux tools to review the secure log files and use the lastlog Linux application to review the previous logins.

To validate that you are in the companyA home folder, enter pwd and press Enter.
   If you are not in this folder, enter cd companyA and press Enter. 

To use the secure log file as a test, enter sudo less /tmp/log/secure and press Enter. It should look like the following:
![Image shows the output of sudo less /tmp/log/secure lists the authentication failures.](images/tmp-log.jpg)

*Figure: The list of errors and failures include the following information: where the user was trying to access from (IP address), if they failed authentication, and which port.*
>**Note**

>Usually, the secure log file is located at **/var/log/secure**.  This lab presents a sample secure log file at **/tmp/log/secure**.
To exit the program, enter q
To view the last login times of all the users on the machine, enter sudo lastlog and press Enter. It should look like the following:
![Image shows output of sudo lastlog command and displays a list of every user and their most recent log in date/time. ](images/last-log.jpg)
